this is the vid that i used for setting up git on my pc (it's in hindi)

step 1:  installed the opencv-python this helps in caputring the video and processing
    this also install numpy as an support library as well

opencv-python:
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/


step 2: created a new file named camera.py and wrote the code for accessing the camera module 
(it worked smoothly lol )

step3: now the next goal was to make an interface (more user frendly) cause at this moment it is just opening up camera nothing to fancy.
sooo let's create a user frendly interface which i know nothing abot lol


Used tkinter for creating the gui user interface:
